            <h3>Filling Orders</h3>

            <p id="testP">
               One of the first steps in working at the dispensary is filling the orders. We average over a thousand transactions
                a day, these transactions come from our online ordering site called dutchie. How this works is we print
                an average of thirty-five tickets every twenty minutes, as someone prints out the orders we have people
                designated to then filling these orders and getting them ready to head out to the dispensary floor.

            <h3>Checking People In</h3>
            <p id="secondstep">
               At the dispensary we only know to fill your order after we check you in at the front door, this is by illinois
               state law which requires us to scan and confirm everyone who enters identification before they can enter the building.
               We do this by first making sure you have a QR code which we scan to check what time you signed up for, then we get your 
               name which we then send back to the vault. This is where we start filling your order and getting everything ready for 
               when you get up to the register.

            <h3>The Register Process</h3>
            <p id="thirdstep">
               The reason I call it the process is because we are still under all of our medical procedures when we are checking out 
               which means that we have to keep your identification out on the counter which can be a little unsettling for some people
               with it still just recently becoming legal in illinois. After we check your id again at the register we should either have 
               your order next to us or we go back into the vault and grab it from there and begin the transaction. We have to verbally 
               say everything that we scan to make sure it is what you ordered and we are checking out the right things, and after we verify 
               all that it comes to payment. We are a cash only business so that is why our card readers work like an ATM, so it is either 
               cash or ATM. Once the payment is finalized we have to check everything off the receipt and make sure we scanned everything
               properly and will not have any inventory issues from the transaction we can finally send you on your way.

            <h3>Counting Inventory</h3>
            <p id="fourthstep">
               One of the last things we take care of in the day is our inventory count, which involves us counting every single item we 
                have in the vault to make sure the number we have in out inventory matches what the states inventory site says we should have.
                We do this to make sure that we are staying in compliance with the states guidelines, if the number that we have is different 
                from what the state says that we should have then we have to move the entire lot of that product into the back-up vault. 
                When that happens we have to put all that product in quarantine, which means we are not allowed by state law to sell tha product
                to anyone until we can fix that issues and figure out what went wrong. However on the other side of that point as long as the 
                number we have matches then we get to go home and call it an easy night.
